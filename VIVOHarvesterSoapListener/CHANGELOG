1.3
	Pubmed script updated for faster scoring
	New Example Scripts
		Web of Science

	Updated CSV VIVO script to properly handled updates
				

1.2
	Scoring
		Tiered Scoring is now implemented allowing for more complex workflows and performance improvements	
	The examples are now located inside the example-scripts folder. Each folder is a self-contained harvest.
		Old style scripts/ and configs/ folder are now deprecated in favor of the self-contained scripts and config files folder.
	remove-last-*-harvest.sh scripts are now in the examples folders.
		This allows you to undo (meaning restore your vivo to a pre-harvest state) the last harvest you ran for each example	
	update pubmed xsl to reflect core:email instead of core:workEmail
	vivo harvester now integrated with vivo web site via ingest menu
		Ingest people and ingest grants via csv templates
	revamped d2rmap, and mods harvester examples
	new csv example script
		allows importing directly from a csv file
	new image import script
		allows for batch harvesting of images to vivo people
	Extraneous debugging info removed
	script formatting cleanups and standardization
	example pubmed script authorship mismatching fixed
		this should show vastly improved performance and consistency
	Harvester minimum memory requirement is now 256mb
	Transfer -h argument changed to -s to prevent confusion with -h being help
	Cleanup copyright headers -- we're now using authors file and standard template headers
	Update packaging permissions to ease post-installation configuration
	Fixed "missing author" bug on ingest publications
	Add symlink to latest log in logs folder
	Added counts to inform number of new objects imported by a harvest
	
1.1.1

		Fix XSLT and script to handle relatedItem recursion better, and add hyperlinks into VIVO

	ChangeNamespace
		Now logs WARN messages rather than ERROR
	
	Fixed Diff lines in all scripts to use Previous Harvest directory h2 models
	All tools should no longer require config files, allowing all parameters to be specified as overrides
	
	Updated xsl of dsr to create dateTimeInterval resources.
	

1.1
    Updated scripts
        dsr example now incorporates smush
        dsr and people soft have corrected previous harvest reference.
    
    Smush
        allows compressing on predicates and filtered on namespace.
    
    MODS
        Fixed issue with improper excludeEntity allocation
        Fixed issue with backslashes in URIs
        
    CSVtoRDF
        Alpha version for future integration into a simple harvest UI
    
    VIVO.xml
        updated to use sdb by default
        
    Qualify
        fix concurrent modification issue

			Availible algorithims to score against:
				Levenshtein Difference
				Damerau-Levenshtein Difference
				Typo Difference (Damerau-Levenshtein w/ Typo evaluation weighting)
				SoundExDifference
				DoubleMetaphone Difference
				EqualityTest (simple 100% match)
		Removed exact match, foriegnkey match, and name match
		Removed output model for scoring
		Combined previous functions along with cmw python code to create weighted search
		now uses TDB as the backend for inprocess temporary jena models
	Node Renaming
		Moved to Qualify Package
		Removed matching algorithms (use score ahead of node renaming)
		Refactored to use sparql queries for determing nodes that need renamed
	Qualify
		In-line string replace
		Moved Sanitize portion of scoring into qualify for removing ontologies/namespaces
	Update
		Wrapper class removed in favor of direct diff and transfer tool calls	
	Merge
		Merge tool created to assist with merging RF; specifically during JDBC harvests
	VIVO.xml
		namespace added
		type added (supported types are sdb, rdb, or mem)

		fix author name scoring bug where it would miss duplicate names
		add initials logic to author name scoring
		fix scoring infinite loop when recursively looping thru nodes
	Logging 
		migrated to logback from log4j
		logging speed is much faster
		by default, only info level and warnings are output to console. this can be changed by setting the level in logback.xml in the root installation folder
		tasks and run both log to there own files
	Example Scripts
		 now utilize environment variables
		 have been enhance to use H2 db by default; which greatly increases harvest speed
		 update all scripts to support and use backups between tool runs
	remapped /usr/share/vivoingest to /usr/share/vivo/harvester
	tool is now known as harvester inside code, rather than ingest
